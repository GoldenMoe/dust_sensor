# dust_sensor
Arduino connected to a dust sensor which triggers output if adjustable dust level is exceeded.

A secondary aim is to have a pull-request webhook for Jenkins to update the Arduino code, seeing as often it may be remote.

Currently, no code has been written. Code will be written once the hardware has been finalised.
